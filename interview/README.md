### What's the difference between stackoverflowError and outofmemoryError

### What is IOC and DI
IOC and DI are used to remove the dependencies. IOC is an idea and DI is the implementation. Instead of creating an object by itself, DI will revieve the object created by some other clients and we will get a loosely coupled software.

### What is AOP
AOP addresses the problem of cross-cutting concerns. It adds additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself, instead they do so by a "pointcut" specification, in spring, it's called Aspect. We can use aspect to do like log, security check.
