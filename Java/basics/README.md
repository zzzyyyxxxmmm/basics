# Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm where the complete software operates as a bunch of objects talking to each other. An object is a collection of data and methods that operate on its data.

## Why OOP
For example, A car have an engine which correspond to variables in Java and a car is able to run which correspond to methods in Java. All of these characteristics increase the understanding of the software.

## Features of OOP
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Inheritance

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation bundles data and methods together. For example, the car hava a engine, window and is able to run. These things are encapulated to make up a car. Besides, some components of car like enginee is hided by car to make it safe. In Java, access modifier restrict the access of component to guarantee the safety of class.

### Polymorphism
A car can take on different forms. It could be a taxi, a bus or a truck. But we don't need to care what the types of this car. All the things we need to know is this car is able to run. It has an engine, a window. In Java, we can create a databaseHelper to matipulate the database without knowing what type of the database is. If you want to change the database, the only thing you need to do is change the code where you create the database.

### Inheritance
The morden car inherits from old car like the carriage pulled by a horse. It reuse some features of carriage like morden car is able to run and have four wheels. But it also has some new features like engine to make it run faster than carriage. In java, inheritance is that a class is based on another class and uses data and implementation of the other class.
The purpose of inheritance is Code Reuse.

### SOLID
